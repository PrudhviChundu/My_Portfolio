1. Place your profile image in the `public` folder
2. Name it `profile.jpg` (or update the path in `src/components/Hero.jsx`)
3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

The image will automatically display in the hero section. If the image is not found, a placeholder with your initials will be shown.

**Recommended image specifications:**

- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Under 500KB for optimal performance
